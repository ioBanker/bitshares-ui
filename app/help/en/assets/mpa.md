## Asumptions

* An *MPA* is a derivative smart contract with the sole purpose of tracking the value of its underlying asset 1:1.
* MPA pricefeeds should be timely, accurate, and honest; always always representing the global median price, with truth and precision.
* Long term borrowers of an MPA will be required to adjust their collateral over time to prevent margin call.
* The purses and interests of the owners of an MPA are more important than the purses of the borrowers of that MPA.
* Borrowers have a duty and personal responsibility to maintain the collateral of MPA's, which they have speculated into existance.
* Holders are lay users who expect and deserve peg and continuity of MPA's, which they own.
* MPA holders expect their owned assets will remain true to their purpose by definition.
* We seek to maintain MPA's near their respective price peg most of the time.
* We can accept extreme short term deviation from peg to achieve liquidation of under collateralized positions.
* Deviation from peg cannot be so extreme as to result in a market wide default via core blockchain mechanisms.
* The mean peg of an MPA over time is far more important than immediate peg of the MPA in any momentary instance.
* We are willing to allow considerable deviation from the peg in the instant, in order to minimize the time spent off peg.
* It is acceptable and expected for an MPA to be slightly overvalued or undervalued relative to the 1:1 peg, in bull or bear markets respectively.
* Monetary policy should NOT be implemented for marketing purposes or to induce borrowing with the aim of inflating the monetary supply.
* Monetary policy should NOT be implemented to adjust for deviation from peg during bullish or bearish market trends.
* Monetary policy should allow market participants the greatest freedom possible to make their own decisions and be repsonsible for the outcome.
* Monetary policy should not waver over time as to benefit some market participants at the expense of others; whenever possible policy should be set in stone.
* Monetary policy  should place the burden of default on the individual borrower, rather than the collective holders.
* Monetary policy restrictions should only be implemented to prevent edge case scenarios which result in prolonged loss of peg or freezing of holder assets.
* Under no circumstance should monetary policy induce an MPA to become pegged to the backing asset (typically BTS).
* Under no circumstance should monetary policy induce an MPA to become frozen by the chain - "supergao".
